		<h1>This is the page fetched by a 'GET' request</h1>
		<p>The name of a file is passed to the 'server' from the 'browser file' during a 'GET' request.  Ideally, a client should be able to type in the file they want to fetch, but for the sake of simplicity, the name of the file to be requested is passed in as a variable in the browser 'file' in this project.</p>
		<p>This is the file returned.</p>
